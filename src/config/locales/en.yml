excuses:
- index: 0
  body: Actually, that's a feature.
- index: 1
  body: Did you check for a virus on your system?
- index: 2
  body: Even though it doesn't work, how does it feel?
- index: 3
  body: Everything looks fine on my end.
- index: 4
  body: How is that possible?
- index: 5
  body: I broke that deliberately to do some testing.
- index: 6
  body: I can't make that a priority right now.
- index: 7
  body: I can't test everything.
- index: 8
  body: I couldn't find any examples of how that can be done anywhere online.
- index: 9
  body: I couldn't find any library that can even do that.
- index: 10
  body: I did a quick fix last time but it broke when we rebooted.
- index: 11
  body: I didn't anticipate that I would make any errors.
- index: 12
  body: I didn't create that part of the program.
- index: 13
  body: I didn't receive a ticket for it.
- index: 14
  body: I forgot to commit the code that fixes that.
- index: 15
  body: I have never seen that before in my life.
- index: 16
  body: I have too many other high priority things to do right now.
- index: 17
  body: I haven't been able to reproduce that.
- index: 18
  body: I haven't had a chance to run that code yet.
- index: 19
  body: I haven't had any experience with that before.
- index: 20
  body: I haven't touched that code in weeks.
- index: 21
  body: I heard there was a solar flare today.
- index: 22
  body: I must have been stress-testing our production server.
- index: 23
  body: I must not have understood what you were asking for.
- index: 24
  body: I thought I finished that.
- index: 25
  body: I thought he knew the context of what I was talking about.
- index: 26
  body: I thought you signed off on that.
- index: 27
  body: I told you yesterday it would be done by the end of today.
- index: 28
  body: I usually get a notification when that happens.
- index: 29
  body: I was just fixing that.
- index: 30
  body: I was told to stop working on that when something important came up.
- index: 31
  body: I'll have to fix that at a later date.
- index: 32
  body: I'm not familiar with it so I didn't fix it in case I made it worse.
- index: 33
  body: I'm not getting any error codes.
- index: 34
  body: I'm not sure as I've never had a look at how that works before.
- index: 35
  body: I'm still working on that as we speak.
- index: 36
  body: I'm surprised it was working at all.
- index: 37
  body: I'm surprised it works as well as it does.
- index: 38
  body: In the interest of efficiency I only check my email for that on a Friday.
- index: 39
  body: It can't be broken, it passes all unit tests.
- index: 40
  body: It must be a hardware problem.
- index: 41
  body: It must be because of a leap year.
- index: 42
  body: It probably won't happen again.
- index: 43
  body: It was working in my head.
- index: 44
  body: It works for me.
- index: 45
  body: It works, but it's not been tested.
- index: 46
  body: It would have taken twice as long to build it properly.
- index: 47
  body: It would take too long to rewrite the code from scratch.
- index: 48
  body: It's a browser compatibility issue.
- index: 49
  body: It's a character encoding issue.
- index: 50
  body: It's a compatibility issue.
- index: 51
  body: It's a known bug with the programming language.
- index: 52
  body: It's a remote vendor issue.
- index: 53
  body: It's always been like that.
- index: 54
  body: It's an unexpected emergent behaviour of several last minute abstractions.
- index: 55
  body: It's just some unlucky coincidence.
- index: 56
  body: It's never done that before.
- index: 57
  body: It's never shown unexpected behavior like this before.
- index: 58
  body: It's not a code problem â€” our users need more training.
- index: 59
  body: Management insisted we wouldn't need to waste our time writing unit tests.
- index: 60
  body: Maybe somebody forgot to pay our hosting company.
- index: 61
  body: My time was split in a way that meant I couldn't do either project properly
- index: 62
  body: No one told me so I was forced to assume which way to do that.
- index: 63
  body: Nobody asked me how long it would actually take.
- index: 64
  body: Nobody has ever complained about it.
- index: 65
  body: Oh, that was just a temporary fix.
- index: 66
  body: Oh, that was only supposed to be a placeholder.
- index: 67
  body: Oh, you said you DIDN'T want that to happen?
- index: 68
  body: Our code quality is no worse than anyone else in the industry.
- index: 69
  body: Our hardware is too slow to cope with demand.
- index: 70
  body: Our internet connection must not be working.
- index: 71
  body: Our redundant systems must have failed as well.
- index: 72
  body: Please ignore that, it's for debugging
- index: 73
  body: Somebody must have changed my code.
- index: 74
  body: THIS can't be the source of THAT.
- index: 75
  body: That behaviour is in the original specification.
- index: 76
  body: That code seemed so simple I didn't think it needed testing.
- index: 77
  body: That error means it was successful.
- index: 78
  body: That feature was slated for phase two.
- index: 79
  body: That feature would be outside the scope.
- index: 80
  body: That important email must have been marked as spam.
- index: 81
  body: That isn't covered by my job description.
- index: 82
  body: That process requires human oversight that nobody was providing.
- index: 83
  body: That was literally a one in a million error.
- index: 84
  body: That wasn't in the original specification.
- index: 85
  body: That worked perfectly when I developed it.
- index: 86
  body: That wouldn't be economically feasible.
- index: 87
  body: That's already fixed, it just hasn't taken effect yet.
- index: 88
  body: That's interesting, how did you manage to make it do that?
- index: 89
  body: That's not a bug it's a configuration issue.
- index: 90
  body: That's the fault of the graphic designer.
- index: 91
  body: The DNS hasn't propagated yet.
- index: 92
  body: The accounting department must have cancelled that subscription.
- index: 93
  body: The client must have been hacked.
- index: 94
  body: The client wanted it changed at the last minute.
- index: 95
  body: The code is compiling.
- index: 96
  body: The download must have been corrupted.
- index: 97
  body: The existing design makes it difficult to do the right thing.
- index: 98
  body: The marketing department made us put that there.
- index: 99
  body: The person responsible doesn't work here anymore.
- index: 100
  body: The problem seems to be with our legacy software.
- index: 101
  body: The program has never collected that information.
- index: 102
  body: The project manager said no one would want that feature
- index: 103
  body: The project manager told me to do it that way.
- index: 104
  body: The request must have dropped some packets.
- index: 105
  body: The specifications were ambiguous.
- index: 106
  body: The third party documentation doesn't exist.
- index: 107
  body: The user must not know how to use it.
- index: 108
  body: There must be something strange in your data.
- index: 109
  body: There was too little data to bother with the extra functionality at the time.
- index: 110
  body: There's currently a problem with our hosting company.
- index: 111
  body: This code was not supposed to go in to production yet.
- index: 112
  body: This is a previously known bug you told me not to work on yet.
- index: 113
  body: We didn't have enough time to peer review the final changes.
- index: 114
  body: Well done, you found my easter egg!
- index: 115
  body: Well, at least it displays a very pretty error.
- index: 116
  body: Well, at least we know not to try that again.
- index: 117
  body: Well, that's a first.
- index: 118
  body: What did I tell you about using parts of the system you don't understand?
- index: 119
  body: What did you type in wrong to get it to crash?
- index: 120
  body: Where were you when the program blew up?
- index: 121
  body: Why do you want to do it that way?
- index: 122
  body: You must have done something wrong.
- index: 123
  body: You must have the wrong version.
- index: 124
  body: You're doing it wrong.
